This is splittted to TEST, TRAIN dataset
the model will then do another internal split of the TRAIN set for TRAIN&VALID, TEST sets

I used the The first TEST do asses the model with images it never seen before,
as the model does augmentations - the split it does might contain images it saw just with flips/rotations.
